COVID-19 Data Analysis Project    
 Introduction
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 datasets using Python. The aim is to analyze, clean, and visualize pandemic data to extract meaningful insights about infection trends, recoveries, fatalities, and vaccination progress across different regions.

 Problem Statement
During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and researchers faced difficulties in interpreting the vast amount of rapidly growing data. This project provides structured, interactive, and visual approaches to:
•	Monitor confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries
•	Track vaccination rollout
•	Identify patterns and anomalies in the data

 Key Features
•	Data cleaning & preprocessing
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Visualization using line charts, bar graphs, scatter plots, and pie charts
•	Insights on infection spikes, vaccination impact, and recovery patterns
________________________________________
 Tools & Technologies
•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
•	Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
•	COVID-19 datasets (Kaggle / Our World in Data / WHO)
________________________________________
 Observations
•	Countries with early lockdowns experienced slower spread.
•	Vaccination rollout correlated with reduced active cases.
•	Social events and policy changes often triggered spikes in daily cases.
•	Death rates varied regionally, influenced by healthcare quality and reporting.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data science can transform raw pandemic data into meaningful insights. The analysis helps in monitoring virus progression, comparing country responses, and supporting policy-making through data-driven decisions.
